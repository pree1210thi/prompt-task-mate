## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todoflow
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### Environment Setup (For Backend Integration)

When ready to integrate with Supabase:

1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Set up authentication providers (Google, GitHub)
3. Create database tables for tasks and sharing
4. Configure real-time subscriptions
5. Add environment variables for API keys

## 📱 Usage

1. **Login** - Use Google or GitHub to authenticate
2. **Create Tasks** - Click "New Task" to create a task
3. **Manage Tasks** - Edit, delete, or change status of tasks
4. **Filter Tasks** - Use sidebar to filter by category
5. **Share Tasks** - Share tasks with team members via email
6. **Real-time Updates** - See changes instantly across devices

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### Frontend Engineering
- ✅ Component architecture with TypeScript
- ✅ State management with React hooks
- ✅ Responsive design implementation
- ✅ Form handling and validation
- ✅ Modal dialogs and user interactions
- ✅ Toast notifications and user feedback

### UX/UI Design
- ✅ Modern, intuitive interface
- ✅ Color-coded priority system
- ✅ Visual feedback for user actions
- ✅ Mobile-responsive layout
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

### Backend Readiness
- ✅ API integration patterns
- ✅ Authentication flow structure

## 🔄 Backend Integration Plan

The frontend is architected to easily integrate with a backend:

1. **Authentication Service**
   - Replace mock login with OAuth providers
   - Implement JWT token management
   - Add user session persistence

2. **Task API Integration**
   - Connect CRUD operations to REST APIs
   - Implement pagination and filtering
   - Add error handling and loading states

3. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket connection for live updates
   - Collaborative editing indicators
   - Push notifications for shared tasks

4. **Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Users table
   users (id, email, name, avatar_url, created_at)
   
   -- Tasks table
   tasks (id, user_id, title, description, status, priority, due_date, created_at, updated_at)
   
   -- Task shares table
   task_shares (id, task_id, shared_with_email, created_at)
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for user flows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance testing for large task lists
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Efficient state management patterns
- Optimized rendering for large data sets
- Code splitting for better performance
- CDN-ready asset optimization

## 🔒 Security Measures

- HTTPS-only communication
- Secure authentication flows
- Input validation and sanitization
- CSRF protection (backend)
- Rate limiting (backend)

## 🎨 Design System

- Consistent color palette with semantic meanings
- Typography scale for hierarchy
- Spacing system for consistency
- Component variants for different contexts
- Animation patterns for smooth interactions

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3s
- Bundle size optimization
- Image optimization and lazy loading
